# DSA Preparation Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation journey! In this README, I'll share my progress, resources, and strategies for mastering DSA concepts. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, I hope this journey inspires you.

## Goals

1. **Solid Foundation**: Understand fundamental DSA concepts.
2. **Problem Solving**: Solve a variety of problems using DSA techniques.
3. **Interview Readiness**: Prepare for technical interviews.

## Resources

### Online Platforms
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks

### Strategies

1. **Learn the Basics**:
    - Understand time complexity, space complexity, and common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
    - Master sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).

2. **Practice Regularly**:
    - Solve problems daily. Start with easy ones and gradually move to more complex ones.
    - Focus on different problem-solving techniques.

3. **Analyze Solutions**:
    - Understand why a solution works.
    - Optimize code.

4. **Mock Interviews**:
    - Practice mock technical interviews.
    - Improve communication and problem-solving skills.
